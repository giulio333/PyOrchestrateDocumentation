# Orchestrator Internals

This section explores the internal architecture of PyOrchestrate's `Orchestrator`, explaining how it manages complex multi-agent systems through specialized components. Understanding these internals helps you build more sophisticated applications and troubleshoot advanced scenarios.

## What is the Orchestrator Architecture?

The Orchestrator uses a **component-based architecture** where different aspects of agent management are handled by specialized managers. Each manager focuses on a specific responsibility, making the system modular, maintainable, and extensible.

## Why This Architecture?

In multi-agent systems, the orchestrator must handle:
- **Agent dependencies**: Ensuring agents start in the correct order
- **Resource limits**: Preventing system overload with too many concurrent agents
- **Communication**: Routing messages between agents and the orchestrator
- **Event tracking**: Recording and responding to system events
- **External control**: Allowing CLI and monitoring tools to interact with the system

Managing all these concerns in a single component would create a complex, hard-to-understand system. Instead, PyOrchestrate separates these responsibilities into focused managers.

## The Six Specialized Managers

The Orchestrator coordinates six managers, each handling a specific aspect of the system:

### 1. [DependencyGraph](./dependency-graph.md)
**Purpose**: Ensures agents start in the correct order based on their dependencies.

If AgentB needs AgentA to be ready first, the DependencyGraph calculates the correct startup sequence. It also detects impossible configurations (like circular dependencies) before the system starts.

**Key Capabilities**:
- Dependency validation
- Topological sorting for startup order
- Circular dependency detection

### 2. [AgentLifecycleManager](./lifecycle-manager.md)
**Purpose**: Manages the complete lifecycle of agents from creation to termination.

Handles registering agents, creating their process/thread instances, wiring up communication channels, and gracefully shutting them down when needed.

**Key Capabilities**:
- Agent registration and configuration
- Process/thread creation
- Event wiring for monitoring and control
- Graceful shutdown

### 3. [WorkerPoolScheduler](./worker-pool.md)
**Purpose**: Controls how many agents run concurrently to prevent resource exhaustion.

When you have 100 agents but want only 10 running at once, the WorkerPoolScheduler queues the rest and automatically starts them as others complete.

**Key Capabilities**:
- Concurrency limiting
- Agent queuing
- Automatic scheduling
- Resource management

### 4. [OrchestratorEventBus](./event-bus.md)
**Purpose**: Unified interface for event handling and history tracking.

Manages event callbacks (reacting to events) and event history (querying past events) through a single, consistent interface. Automatically records events when they occur.

**Key Capabilities**:
- Event callback registration
- Automatic event recording
- Event history queries
- Custom retention policies

### 5. [MessageRouter](./message-router.md)
**Purpose**: Routes messages from agents to the orchestrator's event system.

Agents run in separate processes/threads and send messages to communicate. The MessageRouter receives these messages and converts them into orchestrator events that trigger callbacks and get recorded in history.

**Key Capabilities**:
- Inter-process message reception
- Event translation
- Message filtering
- Background processing

### 6. [CommandInterface](./command-interface.md)
**Purpose**: Enables external control via CLI and monitoring tools.

Exposes a command-based API over ZeroMQ that allows you to query agent status, view statistics, and control the orchestrator without modifying your application code.

**Key Capabilities**:
- CLI command support
- Runtime monitoring
- Security via command whitelisting
- Command audit trail

## How Managers Work Together

The managers coordinate to handle complex workflows:

### Agent Startup Flow

When you start the orchestrator, the managers coordinate:

1. **DependencyGraph** validates dependencies and computes startup order
2. **WorkerPoolScheduler** receives the ordered list and starts agents respecting `max_workers`
3. **AgentLifecycleManager** creates each agent process/thread when scheduled
4. **MessageRouter** begins listening for messages from agents
5. **OrchestratorEventBus** records startup events and executes callbacks

### Agent Communication Flow

When an agent sends a message:

```
Agent Process
    ↓ sends message via MessageChannel
MessageRouter
    ↓ translates to orchestrator event
OrchestratorEventBus
    ├─→ executes callbacks (your code)
    └─→ records to history (automatic)
```

### CLI Command Flow

When you run a CLI command:

```
CLI Tool (pyorchestrate status)
    ↓ ZMQ connection
CommandInterface
    ↓ validates command
    ↓ executes and gathers data
    ↓ returns JSON response
CLI Tool displays results
```
   - Shutdown channel handlers
   - Finalize plugins

### Agent Lifecycle States

```
REGISTERED → QUEUED → RUNNING → TERMINATED
     ↑          ↑         ↑          ↓
     |          |         |    (recorded by MessageRouter)
     |          |    (started by WorkerPoolScheduler)
     |     (queued by WorkerPoolScheduler if pool full)
(via lifecycle_manager.register_agent)
```

## Configuration Examples

## Configuration Examples

### Basic Setup

Simple orchestrator with default settings:

```python
from PyOrchestrate.core.orchestrator import Orchestrator

orchestrator = Orchestrator()
orchestrator.register_agent(MyAgent, "worker")
orchestrator.start()
orchestrator.join()  # Blocks until all agents complete
```

**Default Configuration**:
- `max_workers`: 10 concurrent agents
- `run_mode`: STOP_ON_EMPTY (stops when all agents done)
- `enable_command_interface`: False (CLI disabled)
- `history_max_events`: 1000 events

### Production Setup with Monitoring

Orchestrator with CLI control and increased limits:

```python
config = Orchestrator.Config(
    max_workers=20,
    run_mode=RunMode.DAEMON,
    enable_command_interface=True,
    command_zmq_address="tcp://127.0.0.1:5570",
    allowed_commands="monitoring",  # Read-only commands
    history_max_events=5000
)

orchestrator = Orchestrator(config=config)

# Use CLI to monitor: pyorchestrate status
```

### With Agent Dependencies

Configure agents with dependencies and custom settings:

```python
orchestrator = Orchestrator(
    config=Orchestrator.Config(max_workers=5)
)

# Register with dependencies
orchestrator.register_agent(DatabaseAgent, "db")
orchestrator.register_agent(CacheAgent, "cache")
orchestrator.register_agent(APIAgent, "api")

orchestrator.add_dependency("cache", ["db"])
orchestrator.add_dependency("api", ["db", "cache"])

orchestrator.start()
# Starts in order: db → cache → api
```

### Custom Event Policies

Control event history retention:

```python
from PyOrchestrate.core.orchestrator import EventStore, BucketRingStore

# Keep only last 2 heartbeats per agent
event_store = EventStore(
    capacity=1000,
    event_policies={
        "AGENT_HEARTBEAT": BucketRingStore(capacity=2)
    }
)

# Create orchestrator with custom event store
orchestrator = Orchestrator()
orchestrator.event_bus.event_store = event_store
```

## Underlying Utilities

The managers use low-level utilities for their implementation:

| Utility | Used By | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| [EventManager](../../learn/utilities/event-manager.md) | OrchestratorEventBus | Callback execution |
| [PluginManager](../../learn/utilities/plugin-manager.md) | AgentLifecycleManager | Plugin lifecycle |
| [MessageChannel](../../learn/utilities/message-channel.md) | MessageRouter, CommandInterface | Inter-process communication |

These utilities are documented separately in the [Utilities](../../learn/utilities/) section.

## Common Patterns

### Monitoring Agent Events

React to agent lifecycle events:

```python
def on_agent_error(agent_name, error_message, **kwargs):
    logger.error(f"Agent {agent_name} failed: {error_message}")
    # Take corrective action

orchestrator.event_bus.register_callback(
    OrchestratorEvent.AGENT_ERROR,
    on_agent_error
)
```

### Querying Event History

Inspect past events for debugging or analytics:

```python
# Get recent agent errors
errors = orchestrator.event_bus.event_store.query(
    event_name="AGENT_ERROR",
    limit=50
)

for error in errors:
    print(f"{error.agent_name}: {error.error_message}")
```

### Dynamic Agent Management

Add agents during runtime:

```python
orchestrator.start()  # Start with initial agents

# Later, add more agents
for i in range(10):
    orchestrator.register_agent(WorkerAgent, f"worker_{i}")
    orchestrator.lifecycle_manager.start_agent(f"worker_{i}")
```

## When to Use This Knowledge

Understanding orchestrator internals is useful when:

- **Building complex systems**: Multiple agents with dependencies and resource constraints
- **Debugging issues**: Understanding message flows and event propagation
- **Performance tuning**: Optimizing concurrency and event history settings
- **Extending the framework**: Creating custom managers or modifying behavior
- **Production deployment**: Configuring monitoring and external control

For simpler use cases, the high-level orchestrator API is sufficient.
