# Welcome to the GraphQL Section

GraphQL is a powerful query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries by using a type system you define for your data. It provides a more efficient, powerful, and flexible alternative to REST.

## Why Learn GraphQL?

- **Efficient Data Fetching**: GraphQL allows clients to request exactly the data they need, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching of data.
- **Strongly Typed Schema**: The schema defines the capabilities of the API and allows clients to understand what they can query.
- **Real-time Data**: With subscriptions, GraphQL can provide real-time updates to clients.
