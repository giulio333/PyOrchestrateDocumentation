## BaseAgent

The **BaseAgent** is the foundation of all other agents in PyOrchestrate. It provides the basic structure and lifecycle management for any custom agent. Use it as a starting point to create your own agents with completely custom behavior.


### Key Features:

-   Provides a generic execution loop.
-   Handles thread or process lifecycle.
-   Fully extensible for specific use cases.

### Use Case:

When no predefined agent meets your requirements, the `BaseAgent` is ideal for implementing custom logic.
